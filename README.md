## Requirements

-   Node.js

## Running

### Development

Install NodeJS, then run this in a shell of your choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yobst/heisse-preise-de
cd heisse-preise-de
mkdir -p data
npm install
npm run dev
```

The first time you run this, the data needs to be fetched from the stores. You should see log out put like this.

```bash
Fetching data for date: 2023-05-23
Fetched LIDL data, took 0.77065160000324 seconds
Fetched DM data, took 438.77065160000324 seconds
Merged price history
App listening on port 3000
```

Once the app is listening per default on port 3000, open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.

Subsequent starts will fetch the data asynchronously, so you can start working immediately.

### Production

Install the dependencies as per above, then simply run:

```
git clone https://github.com/yobst/heisse-preise-de
cd heissepreise
node --dns-result-order=ipv4first /usr/bin/npm install --omit=dev
npm run start
```

Once the app is listening per default on port 3000, open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.
